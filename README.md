# Bug Tracker üêõ

This repository contains the source code for a Bug Tracker web application. Built with Go and HTMX. It is currently under construction.

1. First fill out the env file (see `.env.example`)
2. Run `dbrocket up` to push the migrations
3. Run `templ generate` to generate template code
4. Run `air` to start the go server
5. Run `npx tailwindcss -i ./public/tailwind.css -o ./public/styles.css --watch` if you're going to modify tailwind code

## Todo

- Fix errror where if you have a cookie that appears logged in in the session, you cant log in, even if the user does not actually exist

## Inspiration

I typically design projects closely aligned with my inspirations, since I don't focus on showcasing my pure design skills (as they are probably not very good either). My key strength is in transforming an existing design, whether it's a mockup, image, or concept, into a fully functional website with added interactivity, backend features, and more.
